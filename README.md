### 🌐 Professional Focus
I design and deploy software systems that solve physical-world problems. My background in **Hydroinformatics** and **Numerical Simulation** allows me to bridge the gap between scientific modeling and production-grade software engineering. I focus on building reliable workflows for large-scale environmental data analysis.
