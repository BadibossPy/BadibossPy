### 🌊 From Civil Engineering to Geospatial AI
My journey began at the intersection of **Hydroinformatics** and **Numerical Simulation**. With a foundation in civil engineering, geotechnique, and river engineering, I spent years mastering the physics of water and soil before scaling those insights through software. 

Today, I build production-grade systems that solve complex geospatial challenges. I don't just write scripts; I design **robust data lakes**, **serverless pipelines**, and **high-performance models** that withstand the rigors of real-world operations.

### 🛠️ The Architect's Stack
| Layer | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Engine** | `PostgreSQL` `PostGIS` `SQL Design (Sub-500ms Queries)` `STAC` `COG` |
| **Computational Core** | `Python (Expert)` `Dask` `xarray` `NumPy` `SciPy` `FastAPI` |
| **Geospatial & RS** | `GeoPandas` `Rasterio` `GDAL` `TorchGeo` `U-Net` `QGIS / PyQGIS` |
| **Infrastructure** | `AWS (S3/Lambda/EC2)` `Docker` `SLURM (HPC)` `Git` `CI/CD` |

### 🚀 Impact & Outcomes
- **Flood Analytics at Scale**: Reduced national-scale flood damage processing from **days to hours** using Dask/xarray on HPC clusters (INRAe 2025).
- **Serverless Geospatial Ops**: Modernized flood-risk data management with a **Serverless S3/STAC/COG architecture** and high-speed hazard APIs (REOR20).
- **Energy Optimization**: Powered a **4GW hydropower portfolio** with operational cascade forecasting and optimized renewable siting using MCDA (ENGIE/CNR).
- **National Infrastructure**: Engineered the foundational spatial database for **150+ dams**, delivering sub-500ms query performance for critical resource planning (ANBT).

### ❤️ My Passion & Motivation
I am driven by the belief that **geospatial technology is the key to a resilient future**. My passion lies in the **e-water sector**—leveraging digital twins and real-time modeling to secure water resources against a changing climate. Whether it's optimizing a hydropower cascade or mapping flood risks across a continent, I aim for designs that are:
- **Reproducible**: Containers and versioned environments are the baseline.
- **Scalable**: If it doesn't handle TB-scale data, it isn't finished.
- **Transparent**: Clear documentation and observable metrics over buzzwords.
