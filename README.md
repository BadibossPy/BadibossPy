### Geospatial Data Scientist | GeoAI & Hydrology Engineer

Scaling geospatial intelligence to advance sustainable infrastructure, climate resilience, and energy access.

### ◈ Core Thesis
I build production-grade systems where **Hydrology meets Machine Learning**. My work focuses on transforming multi-terabyte satellite and climate datasets into actionable decision tools for global infrastructure.

- **Philosophy**: 0 fluff, high-signal engineering.
- **Goal**: Transitioning research prototypes into scalable, high-performance geospatial pipelines.
- **Focus**: Flood risk, hydropower optimization, and rural electrification (MENA/Europe).

### ◈ Thematic Expertise

#### 1. GeoAI & Remote Sensing
Engineering deep learning workflows for environmental monitoring in arid and temperate regions.
- **Vision**: Arid land monitoring (Sentinel-2) and building footprint segmentation (U-Net).
- **Scale**: Dask/xarray pipelines processing **10+ TB/month** on SLURM clusters.
- **Performance**: Cutting analysis turnaround from days to hours using chunked lazy evaluation.

#### 2. Computational Hydrology
Modeling the intersection of water and risk.
- **Precision**: Calibrating HEC-HMS/Wflow models to **NSE > 0.85**.
- **Extreme Value**: Building IDF curves for ungauged basins using GEV/Gumbel distributions.
- **Operational**: Real-time hydropower forecasting (4GW portfolio) using SCADA/ERA5 fusion.

#### 3. Energy Systems & GeoSaaS
Optimizing energy access through geospatial analytics.
- **Optimization**: OnSSET-based least-cost electrification for off-grid sites.
- **Architecture**: S3-based flood-risk data lakes with STAC catalogs and COG rasters.
- **Serving**: Sub-500ms PostGIS spatial queries for production-grade REST APIs (FastAPI).
